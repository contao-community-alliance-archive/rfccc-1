\item Compatibility to Contao version 2 and version 3 (upcoming).
\item Be more flexible than the current system.
\item (almost) anyone shall be able to run his/her own repository.
\item Installation and uninstallation routines to aid extensions in setup.
\item Standardized package format to ease installation.
\item Improved dependencies.
\item Add possibility to define conflicting extensions.
\end{itemize}
