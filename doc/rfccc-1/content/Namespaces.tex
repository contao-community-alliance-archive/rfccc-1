\section[sec:namespaces]{Namespaces}

Contao 3 extensions should use the PHP 5.3 name space feature. Contao 2 supports PHP prior 5.3 so this section only affects Contao 3 extensions.

\subsection[sec:namespace lock]{Namespace Lock}
\todo{this section needs to be verified against the current beta of Contao 3.}
Extensions can define a name space lock, that means a name space, that is "soft" locked for this extension.
This is a build in feature of the Extension Creator\supref{sec:extension builder} and should prevent multiple use of the same name space.
Soft lock means, that it is not possible to exclusive lock a complete name space, it is only possible to lock one name space level.
For example if a developer lock the name space \DisplFile{myextension\bs} the name space \DisplFile{myextension\bs subnamespace\bs} is not locked.
The developer has to lock every name space he wants to use.

A developer who try to use a locked name space get a warning that its locked from another extension.
Because this only affects the Extension Builder\supref{sec:extension builder}, it is not possible to absolutely prevent multiple use of the same name space.
