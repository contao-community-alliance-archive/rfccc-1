Contao Extension Repository 3
=============================

Abstract
--------

This document serves as a discussion and documentation foundation for the new Extension Repository version 3 which shall replace the existing repository for Contao.

This document will be proposed for discussion at Contao Camp 2011.

The first goal of this document is, to identify problems with the current extension repository and provide solutions to them.

To fulfil this goal, the following conditions have to be met:

* Compatibility to Contao version 2 and version 3 (upcoming).
* Be more flexible than the current system.
* (almost) anyone shall be able to run his/her own repository.
* Installation and uninstallation routines to aid extensions in setup.
* Standardized package format to ease installation.
* Improved dependencies.
* Add possibility to define conflicting extensions.

The open discussion on this document is currently taking place in the [German Contao Community](http://community.contao.org)

This document is still a work in progress and should not be used for implementation yet as all parts are still subject to change. Once the document is finalized, it will get a version number and will be released along with some example implementation of the services.
