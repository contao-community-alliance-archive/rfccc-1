\section[sec:forks]{Forks and successors}

An extension can define, that it is a fork of another existing extension.
The ER3 Portal will link a fork to the original extension and vice versa.

An extension can also define, that it is an successor of another extension.
Extension renaming can be fully traced by the ER3.
\todo{add information where this is to be defined and how. i.e. link to proper section within xml file.}
