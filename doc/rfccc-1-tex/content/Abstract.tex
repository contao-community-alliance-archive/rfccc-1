\chapter{Abstract}

This document serves as a discussion and documentation foundation for the new Extension Repository version 3 which shall replace the existing repository for Contao.

\item Compatibility to Contao version 2 and version 3 (upcoming).
\item Be more flexible than the current system.
\item (almost) anyone shall be able to run his/her own repository.
\item Installation and uninstallation routines to aid extensions in setup.
\item Standardized package format to ease installation.
\item Improved dependencies.
\item Add possibility to define conflicting extensions.
\end{itemize}

The open discussion on this document is currently taking place in the
