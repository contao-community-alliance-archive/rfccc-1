\section[sec:groups]{Groups and extension management access}

Groups are collections of individuals, for example all members of a company or a group of developers, that are allowed to manage an extension in the repository.

An administrator of an extension can define one or more additional users or groups that are allowed to do perform administrative tasks on an extension.
These tasks include (but are not limited to):
\begin{itemize}
\item add I18N packages (translation maintainer).
\item change the description texts.
\item add/upload new versions of the extension.
\end{itemize}

The nature of the tasks that can be assigned to the groups are subject to the repository server configuration as some task might be added via plugins.
